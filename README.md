# RSNA-Screening-Mammography-Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project aims to improve the automation of breast cancer detection in screening mammograms using machine learning. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of radiologists, ultimately improving patient care, reducing costs, and avoiding unnecessary medical procedures. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide, with 2.3 million new diagnoses and 685,000 deaths in 2020 alone. Early detection is crucial in reducing fatalities and regular mammography screening has been implemented in high-income countries to achieve this. However, screening programs are expensive and there is a shortage of radiologists. Additionally, false positive results can lead to unnecessary anxiety and follow-up care. The competition is hosted by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), a non-profit organization that promotes excellence in patient care and technological innovation through education and research. Success in this competition could help extend the benefits of early detection to a broader population and further reduce breast cancer mortality globally.
